# GameCube USB Adapter

This is the source code for a USB <-> GameCube adapter. The adapter
uses a [Teensy LC](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyLC.html) to
make a GameCube controller look like a USB HID device. Featured on
[joy.recurse.com](https://joy.recurse.com/~jtm)!

Note that the source code is pretty janky. I was trying to get something
working in a short period of time, and didn't take the time to polish
everything. Eventually, I'd like to do a detailed write-up, but that
might be a long time from now.
